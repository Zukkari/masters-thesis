\subsection{SonarQube plugin development}\label{subsec:sonarqube-plugin-development}

To fulfill our task of analyzing a large corpus of application to detect the code smells,
we built a tool that is stable, scalable and allows us to aggregate the results of the
analysis in an organized manner.
Moreover, we needed a framework that would allow us to analyze a large corpus of applications programmatically since starting
the analysis manually for every project under observation would be inefficient and unproductive.

For this task, we decided to use the SonarQube platform because it is a de facto tool in the industry to use
for static analysis of the applications.
Not only that, but SonarQube provides possibilities to write custom rules by writing custom plugins.
Since we needed to implement code smells that are not yet defined by the SonarQube, we decided to extend
the tool by writing a plugin that can detect the code smells that are described in subsection~\ref{subsec:code-smells}.

To create the plugin, we followed the tutorial provided in the SonarQube documentation~\cite{sonar_plugin_tutorial}.
The documentation provides guidelines on how to create a plugin with custom Java rules, how to test the plugin and
how to register rules with the SonarQube so that it would find them during runtime of the application.
The documentation relies on an extension of Sonar Java plugin~\cite{sonar_java_plugin}, which provides an API
for the Java languages abstract syntax tree (AST) and basic interface to create rules, which would be used
during the analysis.

However, this tutorial only focuses on running on an instance of SonarQube and not SonarLint, which is an
extension to run the plugins inside the integrated development environment (IDE).
This is relevant because both SonarQube and SonarLint rely on Sonar compute engine, which means that you can write
a plugin for either of those tools and it would be usable in both of them.

During the runtime of SonarQube, plugins can be installed dynamically, either from the marketplace or they can
also be loaded from the \url{/opt/sonarqube/extensions/plugins/} directory as stated in the documentation.
This means that plugins will be loaded dynamically during the execution of the analysis and since the documentation
states the Sonar Java plugin must be included with \verb|provided| scope during compilation (which means that it
will not be included in the final compiled artifact of the plugin), it means that not all of the classes might be
available at the runtime that was available during compilation.

Previously we mentioned that there are multiple contexts in which the analysis can be run (SonarQube and SonarLint),
however, in this thesis, we will only focus on SonarQube because we are interested in the analysis of the large corpus
of applications and it makes no sense to do this manually through the IDE\@.

Thus, we implemented the plugin that detects the code smells described in subsection~\ref{subsec:code-smells} and
can be executed inside a SonarQube instance.

\subsection{Development tools used}\label{subsec:development-tools-used}

To implement the plugin, we used SonarQube as the implementation platform.
We decided to go with the SonarQube platform for two primary reasons.
Firstly, SonarQube is a very mature tool in the industry.
Secondly, it controls the flow of the analysis (project configuration, starting
the analysis, creating the results, serializing and parsing the results, uploading them
to the server and displays them to the user), so we can focus on writing the custom code smell
detection rules.
Finally, it provides other features such as a web API, which can be used for exporting the analysis results.

Scala was chosen as the language for the plugin implementation.
We chose Scala, because it combines features of both functional and object-oriented languages and since SonarQube
API is written in Java, it allowed for nice interoperability between Java and Scala.
Moreover, Scala provides some features that are not available in Java natively, such as implicit classes and
method parameters, and pattern matching.

As a plugin implementation base, we used Sonar Java plugin since it is recommended
base when writing plugins for the Java language and as mentioned previously, it provides
an API to use Java AST\@.

\subsection{Testing}\label{subsec:testing}

Once the plugin was implemented, we need to also test it to test the operation of the plugin.
Testing of the plugin can be split into two phases: testing of plugin internal architecture, such as
rule loading, registration, rule metadata loading and testing of rule definitions, and verifying that
the rule detects code smells if provided with a valid code snippet.

To satisfy the first phase of the testing, we used Scalatest~\cite{scalatest} to write basic tests and to verify
that plugins internal components operate correctly.
We chose Scalatest because it is a standard unit testing framework for Scala projects and it allows developers
to write unit tests in the form of specification.

For the second phase, SonarQube provides a testing framework that allows similarly testing the rules that
they would have been used in production.
In this framework, testing is performed as follows: firstly, you need to specify a rule which you would like to test by
creating an instance of the rule and passing it to the framework, and secondly, you need to provide a code snippet that
contains a code smell that you would like to verify with the rule.

We can see an example of such a test file in figure~\ref{data_class_example}.
This code snippet contains code that a person writing the test would consider a code smell for a particular rule
and as seen on line 3, we can specify which line the plugin should report by placing a comment on that line in form of line comment:
\verb|// Noncompliant {{Optional message}}|.
Then the framework will verify if the plugin reports an issue in the provided code snippet and whether the plugin reported
the same line as marked in the source file and if the message was the same as provided in the source file.
This approach allows us to verify the code smells without the need to run the analysis separately on the server and
detect most of the issues with the definitions during the testing phase.

        package com.example.test;

        public class DataClass { // Noncompliant {{Refactor this class so it includes more than just data}}
        public String field1;
        public int field2;
        }
    \end{lstlisting}
